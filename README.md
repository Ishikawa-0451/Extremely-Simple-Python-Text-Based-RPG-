# Extremely-Simple-Python-Text-Based-RPG-
A really simple python project for my 12th grade python course I made way back. 
I'm currently pursuing Mechanical Engineering so I'm sort of leaving this as my last big coding project
I'm proud of it as i used only what i learnt from the course to make it, completely on my own
As a result its probably TERRIBLY made and full of things that could be optimized but I'm still happy with it.
Definetely feel free to change the damage values, not sure if they were optimal

It imports random for some rng and pickle. Reading text and dat files was like one of the last topics so i wanted to implement that.
Basically the data ALREADY in the python file is fed into a .dat and then read out back into new lists. IDK was a long time ago.
So yeah it makes some lib and text dat file

I kinda added a reasoning system inspired by undertale, I think one day seeing the if else loops and lists in class i thought to myself, 
"Yeah, i could probably make a really small text based version of that with this stuff"

Thats about it, if you're actually reading all this, hope you have a great week! Thanks for checking this little thing out. Oh and play
Undertale and Deltarune if you can, they're GREAT.
